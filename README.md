# responsive-web-design-using-grid-and-flex
 
Hello, I am Salah Uddin, a front-end developer student at Change Maker Educations, Sweden. 
Change Maker Educations (Yrkesh√∂gskolan) offers Education in a post-secondary form that combines theoretical and practical studies in close cooperation with employers and industry. Programmes are offered in specific fields where there is an explicit demand for competence.

Here, I created a simple responsive website using HTML and CSS. I used Grid, Flex, Google Font and Font Awesome.
